# How to start/run code
To run code: 
1.	First navigate to app store and download the free app Expo Go. Once installed, open the Expo Go app and proceed in creating an account or any other instruction it tells you.
2.	Download and Install Node.js. (https://nodejs.org/en/) Expo depends on the Node.js platform for its command-line tools and dependency management.
3.	Find the project folder ‘Ezpayit’ from the zip folder and place it in any directory of your computer. 
4.	First option: Open terminal (windows: type cmd in search box, macos: type terminal in search box) and navigate to the project folder. 
5.	Once terminal opens with the project directory, type ‘expo start/yarn start’ to run the expo server. This will automatically open a browser of the server with a QR code in the bottom left corner.  
6.	Open your Expo Go app and hit Scan QR Code, this will open your camera where you can scan the QR code from the expo server that was opened. This will start building the app and automatically open the mobile application of the project for you to navigate through.
